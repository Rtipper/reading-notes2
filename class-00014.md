# Class 14 Reading Notes | Event Driven Architecture

### What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
- FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.
### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
- Through an emit response that allows a message to be recieved from the client app back to the server.
### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
- observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
### How do you test an event driven system?
- Through Unity Tests, Service Tests and End-to-End Tests - SUT (System Under Test)

### Vocab:
- FIFO Queue: First In First Out queue that checks the items in which order they were recieved, then outputs them as such
- Pub/Sub: publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be.
