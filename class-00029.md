# Class 29 Reading Notes

### Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?
- there is no way to pass props from a child component to a parent component. However, we can always pass around functions from the parent to child component. 
### When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
- by specifically rendering that componenet, either via a className or ID that is then included in render
### Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
- I believe so yes, so long as it is labeled and accessed correctly
### What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children
- Using the spread operator lets you pass the entire props object to a child component as that child's props object

### VOCAB
- props.children: used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
- composition: one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming that describes a class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables.
