# Class 15 Reading Notes - Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

### When Women Stopped Coding
- Modern computer science is dominated by men. But it hasn't always been this way.
- A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women.
- For decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men, until 1984.
- The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.
- The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
- The idea that computers are for boys became a narrative.
- It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution.
- It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.
- Movies and other society changes affirmed this even more.
