### VALIDATE A BST

###### REFS:
- https://dev.to/akhilpokle/validate-a-binary-search-tree-1l1a

###### QUESTIONS/EDGECASES FOR INTERVIEW:
- Should I assume the values of the tree are provided and that it's balanced? Or do I need to also create the tree and node classes?
- Do you prefer if I attempt this as iterative or recursive? Does it matter?

###### TESTING IDEAS: 
- Validate that a node is present within the tree, otherwise return null.
- The tree being balanced (if valid)
- Test for a new node being created along with its value, and if its located left or right
- Validate the tree has a single node at its root
