# Reading Notes Class 12

### What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
- The benefit of transforming data into packets is to be able to transfer them individually to reach their destination. Upon reaching their destination, the destination recompiles the data passed thru the packet to adhere to the protocols of whichever TCP/UDP level they are at in the process.
### UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
- ften refered to as a connectionless protocol because as a connectionless protocol it does not require the two endpoints (sending and recieving) to have an established connection. I think that this is what allows the emit of listeners without needing a server set up?
### Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
- Yes, they indeed can
### Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
- Yes, they can as well, but the client can't connect to more than one server.
### Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
- No, this would requrie multiple and different files

### VOCAB
- Observer Pattern - 
- Listener - functions that await a signal and perform some action when this signal is emitted
- Event Handler - a function that waits for a certain action and responds to the action with an action
- Event Driven Programming - a programming schema where control flow is determined by a series of objects interacting with one another by emitting signals and responding to signals when they are emitted in the environment.
- Event Loop - a construct that awaits events or messages in a program and responds by making a request to some source (internal or external) to respond to the events.
- Event Queue - A data structure that organizes control flow based on a queue structure.
- Call Stack - A data strucutre that organizes control flow by responding to the most recent commands first.
- Emit/Raise/Trigger: A method known as trigger(), in which a specified event and it's default behavior are, for lack of a better word, triggered by an event. 
- Subscribe: An Observable instance begins publishing values only when someone subscribes to it.
- database: An organzied collection of data typically stored on a computed/electronically.
