# Class 17 Reading Notes

##### Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
- FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing.
##### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
- The client will emit a received message, assuring the messaged was received.
##### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
- The observer pattern - a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
##### How do you test an event driven system?
- Through a System Under Test (SUT) setup comprising different parts of your application - Unit Tests / Service Tests / End-to-End Tests

### VOCAB
- Server Instances: a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.
- Containers: a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- Cloud Services: ervices available via a remote cloud computing server rather than an on-site server. These scalable solutions are managed by a third party and provide users with access to computing services such as analytics or networking via the internet.
- Cloud Architecture: efers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them.
- AWS: Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: Heroku's price scaling can be far higher than that of AWS/Beanstalk's, but Heroku is much eaiser to setup, use and update in comparison
