# Class 34 Reading Notes | 

### Why is the Context API useful?
- helps us to skip the mandatory hierarchy of passing props for each component in its component tree
### Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
- Yes, per their intent they are able to get that context if need be
### What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
- enabling components to share some data without explicitly passing via each component manually as well as acting as a global object to the React component sub-tree
### Describe “Context Hell”
- the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API -- it's when you get thing on top of thing on top of thing making it incredilby hard to navigate.

### VOCAB
- global state: a set of local states which are all concurrent with each other
- global context: the global state's general scope when creating it
- provider: accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers
- consumer: A React component that subscribes to context changes.
