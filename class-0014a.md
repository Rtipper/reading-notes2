# Class 14a Reading Notes - Database Normalization

- Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
- The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included. 
- Identify salespeople in your organization
- List all customers your company calls upon to sell a product
- Identify which salespeople call on specific customers.
- By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. 
- This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.
- To achieve these objectives, established rules need to be followed.
- As these rules are applied, new tables are formed.
- The progression from unruly to optimized passes through several normal forms.
- There are three normal forms most databases adhere to using
- As tables satisfy each successive database normalization form, they become less prone to database modification anomalies and more focused toward a sole purpose or topic. 
- The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries.
