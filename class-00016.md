# Class 16 Reading Notes

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
- FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. 
### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
- The client will emit a received message, assuring the messaged was received.
### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
- The observer pattern - a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
### How do you test an event driven system?
- Via unit tests, service tests, and end-to-end tests. In each of these cases, your System Under Test (SUT, what is actually being tested) comprises a different part of your application.

### VOCAB 
- Server: a computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network.
- Pub/Sub: a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be.
- WRRC: Web Request Response Cycle - the cycle of sending requests to an API and receiving a response back.
