# Class 33 Reading Notes |

### Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()
- useMemo() helps with functions that take extra time to run | useReducer helps when a single state can change in different ways within an application
### Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
- so you can tell which functions are actually using hooks and which ones aren't
### What do custom hooks usually do?
- reuse stateful logic
### Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
- useToggle - seems super useful for switching things between and on or off state. Idea could be browsing a list of items with multiple master lists, and you can toggle each mast list to display or not
### Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
- useEffect -- add in a script within the package.json file to run the API url, then utilize the useEffect hook to grab the data from the API then you can send the data back with either fetch or POST

### VOCAB
- reducer - there to manage state in an application -- i.e. if a user writes something in an HTML input field, the application has to manage this UI state
