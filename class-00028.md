# Class 28 Reading Notes

### Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
- In case that you really need to access to a child state that is declared as a functional component (hooks) you can declare a ref in the parent component, then pass it as a ref attribute to the child but you need to use React.
### What can be passed along in a prop variable?
- How you add props into the App component: right beside the call to the App component on ReactDOM.render, type a property name and assign it a value.
### How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
- The most common method is to make a callback function that the child component will trigger and toss the state values upward.

### VOCAB
- component props: arguments passed into React components, allowing for further manipulation of said components
- component state: an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
- application state: the state at which an application resides with regards to where in a program is being executed and the memory that is stored for the application.
