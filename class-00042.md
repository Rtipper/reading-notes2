# Ethics in Tech

### Ethics in the Workplace | Google Backtracks
- This is an ethics discussion as it relates directly to big tech being involved in something that could directly harm others, or, at the very least, put them at risk.
- It's also a show of force from workers, in allowing them to voice their own concerns regarding an ethics based question -- would you get paid to develop weapons that could hurt people, but put money in your pocket?
- In turn, this forced the CEO to backtrack on the decision and turn the AI development focus towards things that will help, rather than possibly hurt people.

### Ethics in Technology | Self Driving Cars
- I personally love the idea of self driving cars -- getting us places faster, more enviromentally friendly and (hopefully) in a much safer manner.
- The ethic dilema on this comes up as a discussion as an AI can still make a calculated decision that ends up hurting some one.
- If an accident is about to happen, self-driving car or not, does the car make the decision to swerve left and crash into a family of 4? Or does it swerve right and crash into the elderly person crossing the street.
- This opens the door to the ethics discussion of "who is more likely to survive" or even, "who SHOULD be given the chance to outright avoid harms way".
- Humans still have to develop the AI and someone has to be responsible no matter where the world goes.
