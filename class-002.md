# Class 2 Reading Notes - jQuery, Events, and The DOM

### jQuery
- jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed.
- SELECT ELEMENTS: It is simpler to access elements using jQuery's CSS-style selectiors than it is using DOM queries. The selectors are also more powerful and flexible.
- PERFORM TASKS: jQuery's methods let you update the DOM tree, animate elements into and out of view, and loop through a set of elements, all in one line of code.
- HANDLE EVENTS: jQuery includes methods that allow you to attach event listeners without having to write any fallback code to support older browsers.
- jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages.
- It also lets you find elements using CCS-style selectiors and thne do something with the elements using jQuery methods.
- Afunction called jQuery() lets you find one or more elements in the page.
- It creates an object called jQuery which holds references to those elements.
- $() is often used as a shorthand to save typing jQuery().
- SIMILARITIES TO DOM: jQuery selectors perform a similar task to traditional DOM queries, but the syntax is much simpler. You can store the jQuery object in a variable, just as you can with DOM nodes. You cna use jQuery methods and properties (like DOM methods and properties) to manipulate the DOM nodes that you select.
- The jQuery objext has many methods that you can use to work with the elements you select. The methods represent tasks that you commonly need to perform with elements.
- jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.

### Pair Programming:
- Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
- The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
- Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.
- The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
- The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
- The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
- Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful.
- Greater efficiency: In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making.
- Engaged collaboration.
- Learning from fellow students.
- Social skills.
- Job interview readiness.
- Work environment readiness.
