# Class 27 Reading Notes

### Does a deployed React application require a server?
- You donâ€™t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It also works well when integrated into an existing server side app.
### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
- To get the most accurate represenation of the app running in the browser
### What does npm run build do?
- Runs the script "build" and created a script which runs your application - i.e server.js
### Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
- Starting off with the create-reacte-app command within the ternimal, the initial app is then created with all of its basic scaffolding and files to get you started. From there, its taking what is provided and adding to it in the way of additional components, JS files, functions, methods and the like, ontop of front end styling with CSS.

### VOCAB
BDD -Behavior Driven Development, an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants in a software project.
Acceptance Tests - a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario.
mounting - the process of outputting the virtual representation of a component into the final UI representation (e.g. DOM or Native Components).
build - the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer, or the result of doing so.
