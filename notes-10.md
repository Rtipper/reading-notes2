# Class 10 Reading Notes

### Error Handling & Debugging
- If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code.
- Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
- The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
- If/Else is a great way to check against error handling.
- Execution Context - Global Context, Function Context and Eval Context.
- Variable Scope - Global Scope, Function-Level Scope
- Console / Dev Tools - Tools built into the browser that help you hunt for errors (break points).
- Common Problems - Common sources of errors, and how to solve them.
- Handling Errors - How code can deal with potential errors gracefully.
- Error Objects - can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have toold to help you read them.
- In VSCode, you can type in debugger into your code, then check the browser inspect console and go through each line one at a time
- Setting breakpoints are an easier version of debugger. Just click the line you want it to stop on, step by step.
