# Class 13 Reading Notes

### What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
- Providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server. They are useful in terms of the server being able to push messages to clients and speeding up that, allowing for real time communication process.
### Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
- Yes, it does use HTTP, the reason being it mimics the behaviour of WebSocket, and acts a fallback for that process.
### What happens when a client emits an event?
- The event reaches the server's socket, which listens for incoming events and reacts accodingly.
### What happens when a server emits an event?
- The server kicks the event out to a specified client(s), or to all clients if not specified.
### What happens if a client “misses” an event?
- The can be setup to be stored in the buffer and then later can be accessed. By default, they should just appear to be skipped, unless otherwise stored.
### How can we mitigate this?
- Buffers are a way to "catch" these to be used/stored. Things like utilizing a timer with a delay is one way to go about this -- i.e. after 4 seconds, a string appears on the screen.

### VOCAB
- Socket:  software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network.
- Web Socket: a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- Socket.io: enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication
- Client: a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server as part of the client
- Server: a computer that provides data to other computers
- OSI Model: Open Systems Interconnection Model is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.
- TCP Model: The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model. The layers are: Process/Application Layer.
- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data.
- UDP: a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet.
- Packets: a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network
