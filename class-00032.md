# Class 32 Reading Notes |

### What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?
- Components are created (mounted on the DOM), grow by updating, and then die (unmount on DOM)
### Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect
- To help in avoiding regeneration of functions when the functional component re-renders. 
### Why are functional components preferred over class components?
- They much easier to read and test because they are plain JavaScript functions without state or lifecycle-hooks, rtend to requireless code and help you to use best practices.
### What is wrong with the following code?
```
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);

    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```
- The infinite loop that will cause the page to constantly re-render and crash

### VOCAB
- state hook - what allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class
- effect hook - adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component.
- reducer hook - acts as an alternate hook to the useState hook to manage complex state in your application
