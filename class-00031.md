# Class 31 Reading Notes |

### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
- Routes! Multiple, different pages can be rendered by creating .JS files and then linking those up to React Dom Routes and rendering them.
### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
- Outside the <BrowserRouter/> -- X
- Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route /> -- This will show up on every page. Delving further into each route and manipulating the component further will still render it on all pages, but have its different styling on the specified route 
- Inside a <Route /> -- X
What does props.children contain?
- is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

### VOCAB
- Composition: describes a class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables
- Children / Child Components: Components of the parent component
- Hash Routing: using the anchor part of the URL to simulate different content. 
- Link Routing: every node constructs a map of the connectivity to the network, in the form of a graph, showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes.
