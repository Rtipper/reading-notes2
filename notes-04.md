# Class 4 Reading Notes - HTML Links, JS Functions and Intro to CSS Layout

### Chpt 4 - Links
- Links are created using the "a" element.
- The "a" element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.
- Common types of links: 
- Links from one website to another
- Links from one page to another on the same website
- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
- Links that open in a new browser window
- Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

### Chpt 15 - Layout
- "div" elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

### Chpt 3 - 
- Functions & Methods: Functions consist of a series of statements that habe been grouped together because they perform a specific task. A method is the same as a function, except methods are created inside (and are part of) an object.
- Objects: Programmers use obsjects to create models of the world using data, and that objexts are made up of properties and methods.
- Built-In Objects: The browser comes with a set of objects that act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.
