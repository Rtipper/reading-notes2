### Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
- Redux allows you to be much more direct with what you're doing with global state and where you are intending to pass it. Context API is better for handling that state non-directly.
### What is the purpose of a reducer?
- It's a function that determines changes to an application's state
### What does an action contain?
- The only source of information for the store as per Redux official documentation. It carries a payload of information from your application to store.
### Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
- Due to the fact that the state can't be directly changed, it has be copied in a reducer.

### VOCAB
- immutable state: an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.
- time travel in redux: refers to the ability step forward and backward through the state of you application, empowering the developer understand exactly what is happening at any point in the app's lifecycle
- action creator: a function that returns an action object
- reducer: a way to modify state via a function within redux
- dispatch: a function of the Redux store that is the only way to trigger a state change.
