# Class 38 Reading Notes |

### How granular should your reducers be?
- As granular as possible, such as when a change of any of those attributes would trigger a separate kind of action.
### Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
- If you have full control of those "firing" and intend it to be so, its a pro. A con would be those "firing" out of your intent or control.
### Name a strategy for preventing the above
- Plan everything out as much as possible when first conceptualizing your site and ALL of its functionality. There is a reason you first build out scaffolds and wireframes and proofs of concept before coding things out. 

### VOCAB
- store: holds the whole state tree of your application and only allows for a change to the state inside it via a dispatch and action on it.
- combined reducers: helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.
