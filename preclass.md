# Class Prework Reading Notes

- Learning HTML5 and CSS3 will in fact teach you the earlier versions of those languages as they are built from them.
- Structure of a webpage works much like that of any newspaper or other paper-based source.
- Headings, subheadings, text, images, navigation etc. are all sources of structure for a webpage.
- Because multiple versions of HTML now exist, each page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration.
- The use of DOCTYPE can also help the browser to render the page correctly.
- Adding comments to code will allow for other developers, as well as yourself, to refernce items behind the code without it affecting its functions.
- ID attributes help for each element to have its own speicifc attribute within the code.
- SOme elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
- DIV element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
- Iframe is a little window that has been cut into your page, which allows you to see another page (think google maps).
- The meta tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your webpage.
- Eascape characters are used to include special character in your pages.
