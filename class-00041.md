### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
- Redux Toolkit gives you much more control over what you can and can't change vs Redux "Ducks" forcing you to work a bit more withing their constraints.
### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
- makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.

### VOCAB
- redux toolkit slices: A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.
- namespace: a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds.
