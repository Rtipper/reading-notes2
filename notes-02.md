# Reading Notes - Class 02

### Headings & Text in HTML
- HTML has 6 "levels of heading (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)
- H1 is used for main headings.
- H2 is used for sub headings.
- If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on.
- The p tag declairs the start of a paragraph within the code itself
- Bolding: either double * before and after a word or typing a b before will **bold** that text
- Italics: either single * before and after a word or typing a b before will *italicise* that text.
- Both sup and sub tags will superscript or subscript your text
- In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines.
- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

### Introducing CSS
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

### Basic JS Instructions
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
