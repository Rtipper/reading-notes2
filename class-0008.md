# Class 8 Reading Notes

### When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
- Basic: transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded using base64.
- Basic: the client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password.
- Bearer: has security tokens called bearer tokens.
- Bearer: the name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” 
- Bearer: the bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. 
- Bearer: the client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

### What does the JSON Web Token package do?
- An open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 
- This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. 
- JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
- JWTs can allow two parties to send data from one another.

### What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
- SECRETs should be stored safely, not made available to anyone.
- The should not be shared with anyone who should not have them
- Restricting of API access and permission should be in place for SECRET.

### VOCAB
- encryption - the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning.
- token - a highly secure format used to transmit sensitive information between two parties in a compact and self-contained manner.
- bearer - an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. 
- secret - a users way to authenticate their ownership of a given token
- JSON Web Token -  an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
