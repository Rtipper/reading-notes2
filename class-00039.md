# Class 39 Reading Notes |

### What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
- fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app. Following this, the use of a reducer will then be required along with a thunk middleware.
### When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
- You would export out the function and its accompanying action creator

### VOCAB
- middleware: software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it.
- thunk: allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.
